# homebrew-tap
My personal tap for the missing formulae and casks.

## Contents
* flutter.rb (Google's Flutter SDK; referenced the formula from [MiderWong/homebrew-flutter](https://github.com/MiderWong/homebrew-flutter))

## Disclaimer
I am not an experienced Homebrew developer. I do not recommend anyone to use my tap. This is for my personal use.
